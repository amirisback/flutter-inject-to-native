    - Copy / Move Inside Folder Android Native
  
  - Submodule Integration
  
    - Code

    ```kotin
    git submodule add <link-repo-github>
    ```

import org.gradle.api.initialization.resolve.RepositoriesMode

pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // Add these two maven entries.
        maven { url '../flutter-inject-to-native/build/host/outputs/repo' }
        maven { url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io' }
    }
}
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_PROJECT) // Change to PREFER_PROJECT
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // Add these two maven entries.
        maven { url '../flutter-inject-to-native/build/host/outputs/repo' }
        maven { url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io' }
    }
}

include ':app'

setBinding(new Binding([gradle: this]))

// Using SettingsDir, because flutter project not siblings but inside the existing project
evaluate(new File(settingsDir, 'flutter-inject-to-native/.android/include_flutter.groovy')) 

```

- Add some code in build.gradle (root project)

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // Add these two maven entries.
        maven { url '../../flutter-inject-to-native/build/host/outputs/repo' }
